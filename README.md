Dependent Projects
==================

There are 3 dependent projects that have been modified and included in this.  They are:
<ol>
<li>execX A slightly modified version of the standard exec from Go. </li>
<li>blackfriday A markdown to html translator. </li>
<li>go-flags Command line flag processor. </li>
</ol>
Without the ability to access/modify and use these wonderful chunks of code this project
would not have been possible.
